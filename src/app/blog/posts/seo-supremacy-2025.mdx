SEO is no longer just about keywords. In 2025, search engines prioritize **User Experience (Core Web Vitals)** and **Semantic Relevance (Schema.org).**

## Technical SEO in Next.js

Next.js provides the best-in-class tools for SEO out of the box, but you need to know how to leverage them.

### 1. Dynamic Metadata
Using the `generateMetadata` function allows you to create unique, context-aware meta tags for every page and blog post. This is critical for social sharing and search ranking.

### 2. Structured Data (JSON-LD)
Providing machines with a "blueprint" of your content helps search engines understand the relationships between your data. I implement this on every site I build to ensure clients appear in rich snippets and "People Also Ask" sections.

### 3. Performance is SEO
A slow site is a low-ranking site. By using Next.js’s Image optimization and pre-rendering strategies, we ensure that every millisecond counts towards your search engine score.

## My Approach to SEO
As a developer, I build SEO into the foundation of every project, not as an afterthought. This includes proper heading hierarchies, descriptive alt tags, and ultra-fast routing.
