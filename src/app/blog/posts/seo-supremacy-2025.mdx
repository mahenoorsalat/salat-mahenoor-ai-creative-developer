SEO is no longer just about repeating keywords. In 2025, search engines like Google and Bing have moved toward **Generative AI Search (SGE)**. This means your site needs to be optimized for **User Experience (Core Web Vitals)**, **Semantic Relevance (Schema.org)**, and **Authoritative Depth**.

## 1. Technical SEO in Next.js: The Foundation

Next.js is the preferred framework for SEO-centric applications because of its hybrid rendering capabilities.

### Dynamic Metadata & Open Graph
In 2025, search engines use the `generateMetadata` function to understand the page's hierarchical importance. I ensure every page has unique:
- **Canonical Tags**: Preventing duplicate content penalties.
- **Open Graph Images**: Boosting click-through rates (CTR) on social media.
- **Robots Directives**: Guiding crawlers efficiently.

### Structured Data (JSON-LD)
Providing search engines with a "blueprint" of your content helps them display rich snippets. This portfolio implements:
- **FAQPage Schema**: Dominating more vertical space in search results.
- **ProfessionalService Schema**: Informing Google about business identity and location.
- **Article Schema**: Ensuring blog posts are indexed with proper author attributes.

## 2. Speed as a Ranking Factor (Core Web Vitals)
A site that loads slowly will never rank high, regardless of content quality. Google’s **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** and **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** are the primary metrics for 2025.

By leveraging Next.js's built-in `next/image` component, we achieve:
- **WebP/AVIF Support**: Reducing image sizes by up to 80%.
- **Lazy Loading**: Saving bandwidth for mobile users.
- **Visual Stability**: Eliminating layout shifts (CLS).

## 3. Semantic Content & AI-Search Optimization
To rank for high-intent keywords like *"Hire Next.js Expert"* or *"Best AI Web Agency"*, content must satisfy **Search Intent**.

My strategy involves matching three types of intent:
1. **Informational**: "How does AI improve web UX?" (Blog posts).
2. **Navigational**: "Mahenoor Salat Portfolio" (Home/About).
3. **Transactional**: "Hire a developer for AI project" (Contact/FAQ).

## 4. E-E-A-T: Trust is the New Currency
Google prioritizes content from authors with **Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness**. By showcasing real-world case studies and client testimonials, we build a trust profile that automated "content farms" cannot replicate.

**High ranking is a marathon, not a sprint.** By combining these technical essentials with consistent, high-quality content, your digital presence becomes an asset that generates leads while you sleep.
