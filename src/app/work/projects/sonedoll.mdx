[Sone Doll](https://sonedoll.vercel.app/) digitalizes the traditional art of Japanese doll making.

## Overview

This project serves as a digital catalog for a traditional Japanese doll maker. It balances the need for a modern, accessible user interface with the respect and elegance required for presenting cultural heritage artifacts.

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: To let the intricate details of the dolls take center stage.
- **Cultural Resonance**: Use of traditional colors and motifs within a modern web framework.
- **Bilingual Support**: Designed to accommodate both Japanese and International audiences.

## AI Implementation

AI tools were used to generate layout concepts and optimize image assets, allowing for a rapid prototyping phase that focused on capturing the right "atmosphere" (kūki) of the brand.
