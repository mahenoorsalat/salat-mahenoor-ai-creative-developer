[Robot 3D](https://robot-five-orpin.vercel.app/) demonstrates the potential of WebGL for creating hyper-realistic, interactive 3D experiences directly in the browser.

## Overview

This project features a detailed 3D robot model that users can inspect and interact with. It serves as a technical demo for high-fidelity rendering, lighting, and material effects using web technologies.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Rendering**: Detailed 3D model rendered in real-time with dynamic lighting.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can rotate, zoom, and explore the model from any angle.
- **Futuristic UI**: A user interface designed to match the sci-fi aesthetic of the 3D content.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React, Next.js
- **3D Engine**: React Three Fiber (Three.js)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

This project highlights my capability to merge intricate 3D design with performant web engineering.
