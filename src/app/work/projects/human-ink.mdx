[Human Ink](https://human-ink.vercel.app/) is a powerful fullstack application designed to humanize AI-generated text.

## Overview

In the age of generative AI, distinguishing between human and machine-written content is becoming increasingly difficult, yet crucial. Human Ink bridges this gap by transforming robotic, repetitive AI outputs into natural, emotionally resonant human writing.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Text Transformation**: Uses sophisticated algorithms to rewrite AI content with human nuance.
- **AI Detection Evasion**: Helps content bypass AI detectors by mimicking natural writing patterns.
- **Tone Enhancement**: adjust the emotional tone of the text to match the desired context.
- **Secure & Private**: Ensures user data and content remain confidential.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API, Custom NLP models
- **Database**: MongoDB

This project demonstrates my ability to build complex, fullstack applications that solve real-world problems in the AI space.
